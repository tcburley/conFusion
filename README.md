A Responsive Mobile First Website (Breakable Toy)

I am designing and styling a web page using the client-side web UI framework Bootstrap 4. To learn about grids and responsive design, Bootstrap CSS and JavaScript components. 
 
I will also be learning the basics of Node.js and NPM and task runners like Grunt and Gulp.

My last focus is incorporating git to focus on using the command line and proper commit messages, pull request, and so on.
